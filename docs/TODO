1) REST-API endpoint /config/devices to support retrieval for a specific device like /config/devices/<serial>
   Have UI use this where appropiate. 

2) restapi.c, check if we can get rig of device_name_from_type(), feels misplaced here.

3) AUX configuration not working as it shares the channel id with R2.

4) Performance friendly debug output of JSON objects. That is do json_dump() only if the loglevel matches.

5) memory leak, should call tty_clode() instead of close(router->fd)

6) Check struct mh_control, set_mode, used for what? Can be removed?

1) DONE: rOptimize REST-API endpoint /config/devices and /config/devices/<serial>. Complete JSON structure tends to be rebuild even after small config change.
   Have UI use this where appropiate. 

2) DONE: restapi.c, check if we can get rid of device_name_from_type(), feels misplaced here.

3) DONE: AUX configuration not working as it shares the channel id with R2.

4) DONE: Performance friendly debug output of JSON objects. That is do json_dump() only if the loglevel matches.

5) DONE: memory leak, should call tty_clode() instead of close(router->fd)

6) DONE: Check struct mh_control, set_mode, used for what? Can be removed?

7) DONE: Make submit_cmd() and derived functions as void return. Currently it returns -1 on failure, but the caller does not always check this. 
   Instead submit_cmd() should call the callbacks even when it fails, so that the caller can react to this. This way error handling has 
   to happen in one place, the callbacks.
   After some reading, even if sumit_cmd() immediately fails, the callback should be called async, that is from the main event loop. See
   ev_idle.

8) DONE: Check renamed functions in libev 4, e.g. ev_unloop() -> ev_break(). We still seem to use old ones.

9) Check signal handler in main.c.  

10) DONE: Use rigctld to sync keyer mode and frequencies from rig to keyer.

11) DONE: If with new json implementation, if VSP can't be created, it gets removed from config. That is, it wouldn't be 
   saved when mhuxd terminates, since it wasn't created. We don't hold a config shadow copy anymore.

12) DONE: dmgr_set_device_added_cb(), quick hack, should manage a callback list as everyone else.

13) DONE: MK2R(+) Small UI issue, when we change baud radio on both radios, click apply for radio 1, baud rate for radio 2 
   resets to original value.

14) When staring mhuxd with no config, keyer off, then turn on keyer, it doesn't get reactively added to the keyer list.

15) Check this, when not setting high baud rate, we may get EPERM

The tcsetattr function with the TCSANOW action translates to the TCSETS ioctl call on Linux. Your con_vsp.c implementation already handles TCSETS (as well as TCSETSW for TCSADRAIN and TCSETSF for TCSAFLUSH), so the plumbing for TCSANOW is present.

The issue is that TCSETS fails with EPERM (Operation not permitted) because the requested baud rate (115200) is being rejected by termios_baud_rate().

The file linux_termios.c currently excludes baud rates of 115200 and higher unless NO_MICRO_HAM is defined. Since this macro is not defined in your build configuration, these standard high baud rates are treated as unsupported, causing the EPERM error in con_vsp.c.

I will patch linux_termios.c to enable support for these baud rates.


16) Consider using acl, eg. by ExecStartPre in systemd integration so we wouldn't need to run as root anymore. Example:

[Unit]
Description=Mein Virtueller Serieller Port Daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
# Der Daemon läuft als unprivilegierter User
User=mein-daemon-user
Group=mein-daemon-user

# Vor dem Start: Dem User explizit Lese-/Schreibrechte für /dev/cuse geben
# Das '-' am Anfang ignoriert Fehler (optional), falls man sicherstellen will, 
# dass der Dienst trotzdem versucht zu starten.
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/setfacl -m u:mein-daemon-user:rw /dev/cuse

# Der eigentliche Startbefehl
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mein-daemon --optionen

# Nach dem Beenden: Rechte wieder entziehen (optional für maximale Sauberkeit)
ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/setfacl -x u:mein-daemon-user /dev/cuse

# Sicherheit: Nur die nötige Capability für CUSE hinzufügen
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_SYS_ADMIN
